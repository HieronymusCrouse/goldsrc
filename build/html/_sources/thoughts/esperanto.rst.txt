Esperanto
==========

Learning Esperanto is a lot of fun.

It's an interesting insight into English, most of the root words in esperanto are adapted directly from Latin.
English is not a Romance language and many of it's words are not directly related to Latin, but Latin is a much smaller laguage than english and most of the root words in Latin have survived in English in some form; usualy in the more esoteric sets of vocabulary. 
In practice this means that you encounter many words with a distinct and clear meaning in Esperanto which are clearly related to an english word. Many words in english have a Latinate version and a more commonly used Germanic equivalent.
